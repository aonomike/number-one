Hello!
======

Hello everyone, this is a fork of a project I've been working on. It simply tells you what was number one (in the UK) on your birthday and pulls up the most relevant youtube video result for that search.

I put it together as I thought it would be a good way to get to grips with querying SQL databases, using an MVC framework (I used Backbone) and so on.

I forked it now as I have implemented the things I initially set out to do, but hopefully you'll agree there's still scope to add lots:

* User sessions via cookies
* Better security (I'm a bit confused about this as I hosted it on Heroku, which uses https. Does this fork need to be hosted elsewhere, and if so would it need its own https implementation?)
* Better styling (my design is a bit rubbish and a bit hacky)
* Maybe adding in something like React
* Pulling in extra APIs

and loads of stuff I haven't thought of.

I hope someone finds something interesting to do with it.

Tom

Things I forgot!
----------------

* Accessibility - v important
* On IE9 the youtube video doesn't load. I have NO idea why, especially as iframes as meant to work in IE9.
